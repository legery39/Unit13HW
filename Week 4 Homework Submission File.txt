## Week 4 Homework Submission File: Linux Systems Administration

### Step 1: Ensure Permissions on Sensitive Files

1. Permissions on `/etc/shadow` should allow only `root` read and write access.

    - Command to inspect permissions: ls -l /etc/shadow

    - Command to set permissions (if needed): chmod 600 shadow

2. Permissions on `/etc/gshadow` should allow only `root` read and write access.

    - Command to inspect permissions: ls -l /etc/gshadow

    - Command to set permissions (if needed): chmod 600 gshadow

3. Permissions on `/etc/group` should allow `root` read and write access, and allow everyone else read access only.

    - Command to inspect permissions: ls -l etc/group

    - Command to set permissions (if needed): chmod 604 group

4. Permissions on `/etc/passwd` should allow `root` read and write access, and allow everyone else read access only.

    - Command to inspect permissions: ls -l /etc/passwd

    - Command to set permissions (if needed): chmod 604 passwd

### Step 2: Create User Accounts

1. Add user accounts for `sam`, `joe`, `amy`, `sara`, and `admin`.

    - Command to add each user account (include all five users): 
    adduser sam
    adduser joe
    adduser amy
    adduser sara
    adduser admin
    

2. Force users to create 16-character passwords incorporating numbers and symbols.

    - Command to edit `pwquality.conf` file: nano pwquality.conf

    - Updates to configuration file: min length 16

3. Force passwords to expire every 90 days.

    - Command to to set each new user's password to expire in 90 days (include all five users): sudo chage -m 90

4. Ensure that only the `admin` has general sudo access.

    - Command to add `admin` to the `sudo` group: sudo usermod -aG sudo admin

### Step 3: Create User Group and Collaborative Folder

1. Add an `engineers` group to the system.

    - Command to add group: sudo addgroup engineers

2. Add users `sam`, `joe`, `amy`, and `sara` to the managed group.

    - Command to add users to `engineers` group (include all four users):
    sudo adduser sam engineers
    sudo adduser joe engineers
    sudo adduser amy engineers
    sudo adduser sara engineers

3. Create a shared folder for this group at `/home/engineers`.

    - Command to create the shared folder: sudo mkdir -p /home/engineers/

4. Change ownership on the new engineers' shared folder to the `engineers` group.

    - Command to change ownership of engineer's shared folder to engineer group: sudo chown user:engineer

5. Add the SGID bit and the sticky bit to allow collaboration between engineers in this directory. 

    - Command to set SGID and sticky bit to shared folder: chmod g+s /home/engineers

### Step 4: Lynis Auditing

1. Command to install Lynis: sudo apt install lynis

2. Command to see documentation and instructions:  man lynis

3. Command to run an audit:  sudo lynis audit system

4. Provide a report from the Lynis output on what can be done to harden the system.

### Bonus
1. Command to install chkrootkit: sudo apt install chkrootkit -y

2. Command to see documentation and instructions: man chkrootkit

3. Command to run expert mode:  sudo chkrootkit -x

4. Provide a report from the chrootkit output on what can be done to harden the system.
